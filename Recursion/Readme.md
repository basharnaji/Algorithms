# Recursion

**Summary:**
The idea behind Recursion is a "procedure" that repeats itself until some condition is met.  Examples of recursion would be:
1. Getting a factorial of a number (i.e. you would multiply a number (n) by (n-1) and keep on repeating until n=1)
2. Counting down like a timer (you keep on decrementing until you hit 0)
