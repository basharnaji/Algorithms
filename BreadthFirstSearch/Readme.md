# Breadth First Search

**Summary:**
Breadth First Search algorithm is a **_graph based_** algorithm that is used to determine the shortest path between two objects.  This algorithm is simple heuristic to determine shortest path as in the number of hops between two object/points.  It doesn't include any "cost" in determining the shortest; Djikstra's algorithm includes cost.
