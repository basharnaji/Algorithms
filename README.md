# Algorithms

This repo is my personal documentation of Algorithms as I learned them, primarily they are based on the book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms?query=grokking%20algorithms).  I've grouped them into different folders for ease of use.

[1. BinarySearch](./BinarySearch)

[2. SelectionSort](./SelectionSort)

[3. Recursion](./Recursion)

[4. QuickSort](./QuickSort)

[5. Breadth-first Search](./BreadthFirstSearch)

[6. Dijkstra](./Dijkstra/)

I also provided [one main file](./utils.py) that has a sample of all these functions.
